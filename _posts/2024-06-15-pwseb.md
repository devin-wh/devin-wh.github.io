## WSL

"WSL" means "windows subsystem for linux", it's developed by Microsoft and supported linux binary running on windows.
WSl provide a middle layer bettwen linux kernel and windows. You can click [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install wsl for your windows.

WSL has two main versions, WSL 1 and WSL 2. WSL 1 achieves compatibility by translating Linux system calls into Windows system calls, while WSL 2 uses a full Linux kernel running in a Hyper-V virtual machine to provide performance closer to a native Linux experience.

With WSL, users can use Linux command-line tools, development tools, and some server applications in a Windows environment without the need to install dual-boot or virtual machines. This makes it easier for developers and system administrators to perform Linux development and management tasks on the Windows platform.

### linux distribution install
```powershell
wsl  -l     -o
wsl --list --online # check the Linux published version list online.

# default install
wsl --install
wsl --install -d <Distribution Name>
```

By default, the installed Linux distribution is Ubuntu. You can change this using the `-d` flag.

- To change the installed distribution, type: `wsl --install -d <Distribution Name>`. Replace `<Distribution Name>` with the name of the distribution you want to install.
- To see a list of available Linux distributions that can be downloaded from the online store, type: `wsl --list --online` or `wsl -l -o`.
- To install additional Linux distributions after the initial installation, you can also use the command: `wsl --install -d <Distribution Name>`.

### linux command example

- After the Linux distribution is installed, the first time you run it, you will need to set up a username and password.
- Open the Start menu, find and click the icon of the Linux distribution you just installed.
  Alternatively, you can run the `wsl` command in Command Prompt or PowerShell.
- Now you can run Linux commands in WSL, such as:

```bash
ls       # List files and folders in the current directory
pwd      # Show the current working directory
cd       # Change directory
sudo     # Run commands with administrator privileges
apt      # Install software using the package manager (for distributions like Ubuntu)
```
To check the IP address of WSL:

```bash
ip addr show eth0 | grep -oP '(?<=inet\s)\d+(\.\d+){3}'
```

With the Remote-WSL plugin installed in VSCode, you can seamlessly interact with WSL from Windows and enjoy the convenience of a Linux development environment.

## clash for windows

Clash is a powerful proxy tool that allows users to route their network traffic through various proxy servers. It supports multiple proxy protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, Shadowsocks, and Vmess (used by V2Ray). Clash is widely used for bypassing censorship, enhancing privacy, and improving network performance.

### Key Features of Clash

- **Multiple Proxy Protocols**: Supports HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, Shadowsocks, and Vmess.
- **Rule-based Routing**: Allows users to define rules to direct traffic through different proxies based on domain, IP address, or other criteria.
- **Customizable**: Users can configure Clash using YAML configuration files, making it highly customizable to meet individual needs.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile platforms like Android and iOS.
- **Dashboard**: Some versions of Clash come with a web-based dashboard for easier configuration and monitoring.

### How to Use Clash with a VPN

When you have obtained VPN details, you can use Clash to route your traffic through the VPN. Here is a step-by-step guide:

#### 1. Install Clash

Download and install Clash for your platform from the [clash download source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devin-wh/devin-wh.github.io/main/_posts/wsl/Clash.for.Windows.Setup.0.20.39.exe).

#### 2. Prepare Configuration File

Create a configuration file (usually named `config.yaml`). This file will contain your proxy settings and routing rules. Below is an example configuration file:

```yaml
port: 7890
socks-port: 7891
allow-lan: true
mode: Rule
log-level: info
external-controller: 127.0.0.1:9090
secret: ""

proxies:
  - name: "MyVPN"
    type: vmess
    server: vpnserver.example.com
    port: 443
    uuid: your-uuid-here
    alterId: 0
    cipher: auto
    tls: true
    network: ws
    ws-opts:
      path: /path

proxy-groups:
  - name: "Proxy"
    type: select
    proxies:
      - "MyVPN"

rules:
  - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,google.com,Proxy
  - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,facebook.com,Proxy
  - DOMAIN-KEYWORD,youtube,Proxy
  - GEOIP,CN,DIRECT
  - MATCH,DIRECT
```

#### 3. Verify Connection

Ensure that your traffic is being routed through the VPN by checking your IP address or visiting a site that displays your current IP address (e.g., `https://www.whatismyip.com/`). The IP should match the location of your VPN server.


## SSH for windows

Windows install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), can also install OpenSSH. Git itself does not come bundled with OpenSSH. However, many Git distributions, especially those for Windows, include OpenSSH as part of their installation packages to facilitate secure connections via SSH.

### SSHD for windows

Windows can use "Git bash" to startup the SSH daemon, please refer to [https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/2406829](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/2406829).

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
```

git-sshd.bat
```bat
@ECHO OFF
setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion
color 3e
title Start SSHD

PUSHD %~DP0 & cd /d "%~dp0"
%1 %2
mshta vbscript:createobject("shell.application").shellexecute("%~s0","goto :runas","","runas",1)(window.close)&goto :eof
:runas

taskkill /f /t /im sshd.exe
start "" "C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe" -c "echo 'start sshd' && /usr/bin/sshd"

exit
```

Place the script in the folder so that it runs automatically every time the system starts, thereby automatically starting the SSH daemon

```plaintext
push git-sshd.bat C:\Users\your.name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
```

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ${username}:${remote}
```

### SSH Port Forwarding

SSH port forwarding is a method of tunneling network traffic through a secure SSH connection. There are two main types of SSH port forwarding: local port forwarding and remote port forwarding.

### Local Port Forwarding

Local port forwarding redirects traffic from a local port through the SSH server to a destination port on another server. It is often used to access a service that is not directly accessible from the local machine.

#### Syntax

```sh
ssh -L [local_port]:[destination_host]:[destination_port] [ssh_server]
```

#### Example

Suppose you want to forward local port 8080 to port 80 on `example.com` via `ssh-server.com`:

```sh
ssh -L 8080:example.com:80 user@ssh-server.com
```

Explanation:
- `-L` specifies local port forwarding.
- `8080` is the local port on your machine.
- `example.com` is the destination host.
- `80` is the port on the destination host.
- `user@ssh-server.com` is the SSH server and user you are connecting through.

After running this command, you can access `http://localhost:8080` on your local machine, and the traffic will be securely forwarded to `example.com:80`.

### Remote Port Forwarding

Remote port forwarding redirects traffic from a port on the SSH server to a port on the local machine or another server. It is useful for exposing a local service to the outside world.

#### Syntax

```sh
ssh -R [remote_port]:[destination_host]:[destination_port] [ssh_server]
```

#### Example

Suppose you want to forward port 9090 on `ssh-server.com` to port 8080 on your local machine:

```sh
ssh -R 9090:localhost:8080 user@ssh-server.com
```

Explanation:
- `-R` specifies remote port forwarding.
- `9090` is the port on the SSH server.
- `localhost` refers to the local machine (relative to `ssh-server.com`).
- `8080` is the port on your local machine.
- `user@ssh-server.com` is the SSH server and user you are connecting through.

After running this command, you can access `http://ssh-server.com:9090` on the SSH server, and the traffic will be securely forwarded to `localhost:8080` on your local machine.
